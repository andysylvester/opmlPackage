# Browser-based OPML

JavaScript code for parsing and stringifying OPML structures, subscribing to outlines via websockets, displaying an outline in the browse.



The core code for the browser version is opml.js.

It uses routines in several of my libraries:

* utils.js

* xml.js

It also uses jQuery.

The demo app, in index.html and its two included files, code.js and styles.css, does something which I will explain here.

You can run the test app from scripting.com.
